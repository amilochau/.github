## Current quarter

### 2023 Q3

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Icons | `web` | Our websites lack a strong UI identity. Thanks to generative AI, we can now generate icons and images more easily. |
| üîú | Landing pages | `web` | External users coming to our websites can't easily understand what they can do with them. We should add landing pages to explain the main available features. |
| üîú | Use AWS X-Ray | `infra`, `monitoring` | Multiple services hosted in AWS are hard to monitor, with their many dependencies. We should use AWS X-Ray. |
| | Secure private data | `infra`, `network` | Data storages can contain sensitive data. We should add another security layer using network isolation. |
| | AWS budgets | `infra`, `monitoring` | With more services hosted in AWS, we should now manage budgets to avoid surprises with consumption-based resources. |

## Future quarters

These roadmap items are expected to be delivered soon. The dates indicated here are informative, and could change in the future.

### 2023 Q4+

| Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ---- | ------- |
| Setup alerts on monitoring | `infra`, `monitoring` | Our resources are now monitored with different metrics and logs. We should configure alerts to be notified when thresholds on KPIs are met. |
| Use reusable GitHub workflows | `devops` | Instead of re-defining workflows in each repository, we should use reusable GitHub workflows, using our centralized GitHub Actions. |
| Migrate to .NET 8 | `csharp`, `core` | New versions for Microsoft-stack frameworks are regularly released. We should migrate our libraries and applications, and adapt our templates and workflows. |

### 2023

#### 2023 Q2

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Abandon SQL databases | `storage` | Azure SQL databases are expensive, and rarely match our needs - as we now use more hierarchical data. We should abandon SQL databases in our applications, and propose more efficient alternatives based on AWS services. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Migrate contacts to AWS | `infra`, `microservices` | The contacts microservice is hosted on Azure. Now we want to use AWS, we should migrate to a new Lambda-based application. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Migrate CV to AWS | `infra`, `microservices` | The CV page is hosted on Azure. Now we want to use AWS, we should migrate to a new S3-based application, using vue.js v3. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Abandon Azure | `infra`, `devops` | AWS is a proven way to make serverless applications better than Azure. We should migrate all our workloads. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use Leaflet for maps | `web`, `maps` | Google Maps have poor performances and lacks important data. We should use leaflet, with OpenStreetMaps data. |

#### 2023 Q1

| State | Title | Tags | Comment |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Setup AWS Cognito | `infra`, `auth` | AWS Cognito can be used to authenticate our future Lambda-based services. We should setup it, and integrate it with our Front-End libraries. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use native AOT for .NET | `infra`, `csharp` | New deployment models help to reduce cold start duration. We should build our Lambda-based applications as native AOT code, so we improve performances and decrease cost. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use AWS for emails | `infra`, `microservices` | AWS proposes integrated workflows to send emails, with SES v2. We should define a Lambda-based process and migrate from Azure. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Use AWS for maps | `infra`, `microservices` | AWS proposes efficient serverless resources, with Lambda functions, API Gateway and CloudFront. We should rework the maps microservice as a Lambda-based application, and migrate from Azure. |
| ‚úîÔ∏è | Separate operations from *milochau.com* | `infra`, `microservices`, `business` | Operations are a specific business domain, today grouped in the *milochau.com* application. We should separate them, and deploy the new `operations` application as a serverless, Lambda-based application. |
